Log in to the background to grab data packets and obtain Cookie information. Local host starts http service:

Look for the functional points for image upload as follows:

Select network extraction:

There is a malicious php file in the local http service directory. The test.php file exists below, and its content is as follows:

Enter any image address at random, such as: https://www.baidu.com/img/flexible/logo/pc/result@2.png Capture data packets, modify the remote image address to the address of the malicious script:

Although the status code of the echo packet is 500, it can be found that the malicious file has been downloaded and saved on the server!

# Code Analysis

The picManager function exists in the picmanager.php file. When the variable type=extract, the getImg method will be called:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e5ea212-3358-4723-aae8-b07c705a889a)

Following up on the getImg method, it was found that the download method would be called to download remote images

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d572db44-cea0-4629-9094-b4bf44eb1d44)

In the download method, the file will be directly written to the server through the file_put_contents function!

Back in the getImg method, the upload method will be called afterwards, and then follow up in this method:

The original type of the obtained file will be obtained above! Then the validationSuffix function determines whether the file type is valid!

There is an upload whitelistï¼š

There is no satisfaction here! So it returned "code=0", and eventually prompted that the upload failed, as well as subsequent status codes and other information. There is a logical error here: The type was determined after the file was written to the server!
